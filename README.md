This script produces graphs of the kinetic, potential and total energy of a 1kg mass falling from rest.

It was created quickly for primarily educational purposes as an aid when teaching projectile mechanics to GCSE & A Level students. Accordingly the script does not:

 - Consider any resistive drag forces.

 - Simulate the motion, the initial height the projectile is dropped from is set, and the array which stores values for the time (in seconds) was calibrated by solving the equations of motion by hand.

 - Consider any possible rotation of the projectile whilst it falls.


This script will be updated over time, currently the next proposed updates are:

 - Modifying the code so that it properly simulates the motion rather than requiring a predefined timestep array (Implemented 04/10/2022)

 - Adding code for the "vertical launch" scenario, i.e. throwing a projectile directly upwards

 - Implementing code for a projectile launched at an angle from the ground, this is particularly intended to aid A Level students.

 - Implement linear resistive drag forces

 - Implement quadratic reistive drag forces

The first 3 updates should be completed by Christmas 2022. The following 2 are then scheduled to be completed by Easter 2022, as they will only be directly useful for teaching students studying the further mechanics modules of A Level Further Maths.
